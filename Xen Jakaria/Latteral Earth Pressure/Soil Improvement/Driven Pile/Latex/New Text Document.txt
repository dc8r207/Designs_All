The design procedure for granular columns in cohesive soils involves bearing capacity, settlement, rate of consolidation, and global slope stability. The typical procedure is as follows:

\item Based on undrained shear strength of cohesive soil,calculate the ultimate bearing capacity of natural soilas 5c u (cu is undrained shear strength of soil).

\item Based on undrained shear strength of cohesive soil,calculate the ultimate bearing capacity of individual columns using Equation (1) or (2).
\item Calculate the ultimate bearing capacity of the composite foundation by considering ultimate bearing capacities of natural soil and individual columns, and the area replacement ratio using Equation (3).
\item Based on the coefficient of volumetric compression,calculate the settlement of the natural soil using Equation (4).
5. Based on the columnâ€“soil modulus ratio or column
friction angle, calculate the stress reduction factor or
improvement factor and then calculate the settlement
of the composite foundation using Equation (5.29) or
(5.31). 
6. The degree of consolidation of a composite foundation
can be estimated using the Han and Ye solution considering well resistance using Equation (5.47). In this
calculation, the permeability of the column should be
estimated first, possibly using the FHWA highway
drainage method Equation (5.49).
7. The factor of safety against global slope failure can
be calculated using the individual column method or
equivalent area method. When the equivalent area
method is used for undrained analysis, a reduction
factor of 0.9 should be applied to the calculated value.
